Project Submission Readme

Submission contains a Final Project Report, Dataset and the Codes.
Code Folder structure is explained below:
* Dataset folder includes the raw dataset and preprocess outputs.
* clustering folder contains a Jupyter notebook for the implementation of clustering techniques  on dataset.
* preprocess folder contains several python files for different preprocess steps.
* lstm.py file is the core file which contains neural network based implementation for the task.
* `naive_bayes_and_knn.py` file contains the naive bayes and knn implementations. 
* In multivariate folder, `CNN.py` file contains the cnn approach to the problem.
* PageRank algorithm can be run by using run.py file in the PageRank folder. It uses preprocessed data file and ports file. 

You can use the `lstm.py` file to run and test the codes. First you should change the dataset path, then you can run the main method. It will take a long time since it is training a deep neural network. Process is same for the naive_bayes_knn.py, run.py and cnn.py files.

All implementation details and methodologies can be found in the final report.
